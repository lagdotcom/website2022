Trying to make a website again. This time I'm starting from a Next.js base, we'll see how much I do with it.

There's two major things coming up in my life right now:

- 7DRL 2022 runs between the 5th and 13th of March. I'm going to be teaming up with [zan-zan](https://twitter.com/zanzanzawa) again to produce a traditional roguelike experience with a nature-hacking twist.
- [Diggin' It](https://lagdotcom.itch.io/diggin-it), last year's 7DRL project, will officially release in its final version on the 11th of March.
