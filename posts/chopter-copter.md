Well, I teased it a few months ago but it's finally done. Here at Sad Folks Interactive we've released our first commercial game: [Chopter Copter](https://sadfolks.itch.io/chopter-copter)! It's an arcade-style score attack for the Playdate, a retro-ish handheld with a novel input method. Give it a try _if you dare_!!!!!!!
