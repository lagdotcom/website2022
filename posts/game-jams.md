As an excellent person who remembers to update their blog constantly, I have a few things to show you since my last post.

Firstly is a game created for the Dungeon Crawler Jam 2023 called [Poisoned Daggers](https://lagdotcom.itch.io/poisoned-daggers). It's quite unfinished but still a fun experience, I hope!

Secondly is... a game created for the 7DRL Challenge 2023! It seems like that's the only way to make me release a game. This one is called [Cravespace](https://lagdotcom.itch.io/cravespace) and it is _very_ unfinished.

Both concepts are something the rest of Sad Folks and I want to expand on, so look for updates in the future.

Our Playdate title Chopter Copter is nearly completion, due to be released in the next couple of months.
